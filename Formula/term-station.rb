  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Start `term-station` in an interactive terminal.
      Press Ctrl+B, then D to detach and keep your shell sessions running.
      Layout and session state are stored in ~/.local/state/term-station/.
      When upgrading with detached sessions running, keep their old runtime:
        HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1 brew upgrade KMMoonlightQ/tools/term-station
      Run cleanup only after sessions using older versions have ended.
      Application mouse forwarding requires a new daemon. Save your work before
      stopping the old daemon: `term-station stop --yes` ends all its shell sessions.
      Then start `term-station` again, or use a separate --state-dir to try it safely.
